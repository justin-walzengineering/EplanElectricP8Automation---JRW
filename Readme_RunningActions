Method for running an action:
Method 1 (Recommended):
In Eplan, go to [Utilities]>[Scripts]>[Load]
Choose "C:\Users\(User)\Documents\GitHub\EplanElectricP8Automation---JRW\01_First_Steps - ToDo\01_ExecuteEplanAction.cs" file from the file location.
This file location may not be the exact same, it is dependent on the location you download the folder from github to. 
The file will be a .cs extension.
This is going to create a new menu item located at [Utilities]>[EPLAN Action to Run].
When user clicks on this, a pop up occurs labeled "ExecuteEplanAction"
On the open bar, this is where you will put the action name of the action from the script. 
The action name is found in the script and usually looks liked this: 
[DeclareAction("Actionname")]
In this case, "Actionname" will be what is placed in the {Command Line:} box. 
Click [OK]



Method 2 (Long version):
In Eplan, right click on the Toolbar. This will bring up a menu that will allow user to turn toolbars on/off. 
Click on [Customize...]. A pop up window will occur, named {Customize}.
Click on tab [Commands]
In Categories window click on [Actions]
Drag and drop one of the actions into the toolbar (it doesn't matter which one, as it is only to get to the next pop up screen)
A pop up screen will appear labeled {Set Button}
On {Command Line:}, this is where you will put the action name of the action from the script. 
The action name usually looks liked this: 
[DeclareAction("Actionname")]
In this case, "Actionname" will be what is placed in the {Command Line:} box. 
Click [OK]
Once the tool is on the toolbar, click the button to perform the action.
