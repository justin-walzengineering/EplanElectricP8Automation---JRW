Method for running an action:
In Eplan, right click on the Toolbar. This will bring up a menu that will allow user to turn toolbars on/off. 
Click on [Customize...]. A pop up window will occur, named {Customize}.
Click on tab [Commands]
In Categories window click on [Actions]
Drag and drop one of the actions into the toolbar (it doesn't matter which one, as it is only to get to the next pop up screen)
A pop up screen will appear labeled {Set Button}
On {Command Line:}, this is where you will put the action name of the action from the script. The action name usually looks liked this: 
[DeclareAction("Actionname")]
In this case, "Actionname" will be what is placed in the {Command Line:} box. 
Click [OK]
Once the tool is on the toolbar, click the button to perform the action.
